# _piClinic_ Principles for Digital Development

This section describes how the _**piClinic**_ development applies the [Principles for Digital Development](https://digitalprinciples.org).

## Design with the user

The _**piClinic**_'s users have been at the center of the the development process from the beginning. Throughout the development process, user needs and pain points have been studied through repeated in-situ observations and interviews. The _**piClinic**_ is designed to adopt and adapt as these needs and pain points evolve.

## Understand the existing ecosystem

Rather than replace existing patient information systems, the _**piClinic**_ is designed to merge into them. The _**piClinic**_'s goal is to apply technology where technology provides a cost-effective advantage and retain existing processes that continue to demonstrate their benefits. 

## Design for scale

While the _**piClinic** Console_ is designed to serve small clinics, the system design is such that it can scale up for larger clinics and health centers that also have limited resources for information systems. 

## Build for sustainability

The _**piClinic**_'s system hardware and software are intentionally kept as simple and as straightforward as possible to support adoption and development. The use of open-source software and easy-to-obtain, off-the-shelf hardware also contribute to the device's and the project's sustainability.

## Be data driven

The goal of the _**piClinic**_ is to make it easier to collect and compile the public health data at the source&mdash;where the patient meets the healthcare provider. The _**piClinic**_ Console also collects operational and usage data to improve future designs.

## Use open standards

The _**piClinic**_ is built on open-source hardware and software. The _**piClinic**_ software is stored in open repos (github.com) and is licensed for sharing and reuse.

## Reuse and improve

The _**piClinic**_'s open and modular design enables adoption and substitution of individual functions to accommodate future innovations.

## Address privacy & security

Maintaining the security of the patient information that the _**piClinic**_ collects and stores is a fundamental part of the _**piClinic**_'s system design.

## Be collaborative

A successful collaboration with our development partners and supporters is key to the _**piClinic**_'s success. Visit our [growing list of supporters and collaborators]({{site.baseurl}}/thanks).
